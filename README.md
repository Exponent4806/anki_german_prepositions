# Prepositions

## About this Deck

This deck contains (all?) 74 German prepositions, along with the case they take and an example sentence (and English translations).
I am unaware of any that are missing, and a native German speaker said that they could not think of any I had missed out.

I took the initial list and usage notes from the book "Grammatik Aktiv", then personally wrote the example sentences and performed the translations myself.
The German sentences were checked by a native German speaker and the translations were checked by a professional German->English translator.
The translator and I are both native English speakers, so there are unlikely to be errors, but we are only human.


## How it was created.

The cards primarily use masculine nouns so that it may be distinguished from the sentence whether a preposition takes the dative or genitive case.

I used the (Add note id)[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1672832404] plugin to add ids to the notes in case I need to make future corrections.


## Card format

The front of each card is a german preposition with an English example sentence.
The back of each card is the translation of the preposition, the case it takes, and the German sentence.

Some cards have an additional comment to clarify the context, for instance; indicating if a preposition comes before or after the word to which it is applied.


## Last words

I hope this deck is useful. If you find any errors or omissions then please let me know by emailing ankistuff@ethernull.org and I'll take a look.
Before you email though, please consider whether what is already in the deck is an equally valid (albeit alternative) translation.
In such cases I would not update the deck, as I might then receive an email suggesting the first translation!
